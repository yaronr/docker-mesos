docker-mesos
=====

A distributed computing cluster-in-a-box: Mesos, zookeeper, chronos, marathon, storm + add your own. 

Use other physical computers to add computational power to the cluster.

I decided to build this setup in order to be able to work with Mesos and its frameworks on a laptop. 

The first setup that I found, that actually worked, was [vagrant-mesos](https://github.com/everpeace/vagrant-mesos). However, I quickly realized that my laptop can't carry the weight of so many VMs.

Next, I searched for a Docker.io based setup (but couldn't find one): Docker offers a more elegant - and resource efficient approach, plus - it potentially offers a scenario where developers use the exact same setup in development and in production (Dev-Ops). That carries a lot of weight.

This work is inspired by [storm-docker](https://github.com/wurstmeister/storm-docker), the wonderful work of wurstmeiser - a clean and elegant Docker based Apache Storm setup.

The root of the project is [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25217208/setting-up-a-docker-fig-mesos-environment/25218202?noredirect=1#comment39342354_25218202) stackoverflow question, and the detailed response by Mark O`Connor (Thank you Mark!).


I decided to take this solution forward and share it with the community - hopefully getting other people to contribute. It's no rocket scinence, and a few tweaks here and there can make a big difference.


###Use:
* Clone repository
* ./build.sh
* fig up

To open up the Mesos UI, open http://your docker host's IP:15050

To open up the Storm UI, open http://your docker host's IP:49080

Chronos UI: open http://your docker host's IP:14400

Marathon UI: open http://your docker host's IP:18080

If you're using boot2docker, to find out your docker host's IP, run <br/>$> boot2docker ip


###Known issues & Workarounds:
* Storm fails to run topologies. UI works, you can submit, but executors seem to die silently. Working on it, appreciate help if you have the time.
* When using boot2docker versions older than 1.2 (on mac, probably other platforms as well), Chronos and / or Marathon fail,  trying to increase the number of open file descriptors.
This is solved in [boot2docker 1.2 pull 166](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/pull/466) so please do:

```
 boot2docker down
 boot2docker upgrade
 boot2docker up
```

##TODO:
* Centralized monitoring? [Ganglia?](http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/)
* [Centralized logging?](http://jasonwilder.com/blog/2012/01/03/centralized-logging/)  [Flume?](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLUME/Home%3bjsessionid=DE02EE9AD41DCFE2E244B6C03FF36B06)
* Process supervision for zookeeper?
* drive mapping for logging
* store images at hub.boot2docker.com + auto build


##PS

This is a work in progress, and I would appreciate individual contributions.
